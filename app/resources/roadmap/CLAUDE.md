Context for /resources/roadmap

- Purpose: Share shipped items, near-term plans, and data stats without impacting SEO focus. Robots set to noindex to avoid diluting topical clusters before features launch.
- Data: Reads `public/businesses_analysis_20250815_022416.json` for headline metrics (documents, services, free services, geocoding rate). Update the analysis file when backend regenerates.
- Links: Provide clear navigation back to `/app` and `/resources/faq`.

Next steps
- Add MDX-driven change log once the blog/resources system is live.
- When launching new features (e.g., scheduler, preventive plan), move them to indexable pages and update internal links.
