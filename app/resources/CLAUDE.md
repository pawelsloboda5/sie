Context for /resources pages

- Added `/resources/faq` as a dedicated FAQ page. No FAQPage JSON‑LD here (homepage and programmatic pages carry JSON‑LD). Purpose: avoid diluting homepage intent while providing comprehensive answers.
- Consider adding `/resources/roadmap` later for “coming soon” items (AI scheduler, Preventive Care Plan). Keep that page noindex until 30 days pre‑launch of each feature.

Next steps
- Expand FAQ content as we collect user questions. Keep answers product‑truthful and up‑to‑date.
