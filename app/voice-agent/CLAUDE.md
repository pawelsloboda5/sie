# AI Voice Agent Implementation Context

## 🎯 Current Implementation Status

### Project Goal
Implementing a sophisticated AI voice agent calling demo with two distinct agents:
1. **AI Agent Caller** - Healthcare appointment scheduler 
2. **Receptionist Agent** - Provider's receptionist

### Key Requirements from Analysis
- **MCP Server Integration**: Use existing `get_voice_agent_context(providerId)` tool
- **ElevenLabs TTS**: Streaming audio with `eleven_turbo_v2_5` model for low latency

- [ ] Verifying MCP server integration with real IDs

### 📊 Technical Context

#### Existing Architecture
- **Next.js 15 + React 19**: Server components with async transitions
- **MongoDB Integration**: Provider/service data via `sie/app/api/search/route.ts`
- **Current Voice Agent Utils**: `sie/lib/voiceAgent.ts` (localStorage-based)

#### MCP Server Context (from HOW.md)
```typescript
// Critical Provider Object Structure
interface Provider {
  _id: string;                    // MongoDB ObjectId - CRITICAL
  name: string;
  category: string;
  address: string;
  phone: string;
  accepts_uninsured: boolean;
  medicaid: boolean;
  medicare: boolean;
  telehealth_available: boolean;
  free_service_names?: string[];
}

// MCP Tools Available
- get_voice_agent_context(providerId) // PRIMARY tool for call context
- get_provider_by_id(providerId)      // Provider details  
- get_provider_services(providerId)   // Available services
```

#### ElevenLabs Integration Patterns
```typescript
// Streaming TTS Configuration
{
  model_id: "eleven_turbo_v2_5",     // Low latency
  output_format: "mp3_44100_64",     // Optimized streaming
  voice_settings: {
    stability: 0.3,                   // More expressive
    similarity_boost: 0.75           // Clear voice quality
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Next Implementation Steps

### Step 1: API Route Creation
- Create `/api/voice-agent-call/route.ts`
- Implement MCP server communication
- Add provider context retrieval
- Handle streaming TTS integration

### Step 2: Conversation Engine
- Design multi-turn state machine
- Implement realistic dialogue flow
- Add context-aware responses
- Handle voice switching logic

### Step 3: Frontend Integration
- Update existing AgentCallSimulator component
- Add real-time audio streaming
- Implement call progress tracking

## 🎭 Agent Persona Definitions

### AI Agent Caller (Voice: Jessica)
```
Role: Professional healthcare appointment scheduler
Personality: Polite, empathetic, patient-focused
Knowledge: Patient preferences, insurance info, scheduling needs
Goal: Successfully schedule appropriate appointment
Sample: "Hello, I'm calling to schedule an appointment for my patient who needs [service type]. They have [insurance] and prefer [time preferences]."
```

### Receptionist Agent (Voice: Bella)  
```
Role: Healthcare provider receptionist
Personality: Helpful, efficient, knowledgeable
Knowledge: Provider services, availability, requirements
Goal: Assist with scheduling per provider protocols
Sample: "Thank you for calling [Provider Name]. I'd be happy to help you schedule an appointment. What type of service are you looking for?"
```

## 🚨 Critical Implementation Notes

### MCP Server Integration
- Use provider MongoDB ObjectId from existing search/filter APIs
- Call `get_voice_agent_context(providerId)` for comprehensive context
- Handle MCP server connection properly (stdio protocol, not HTTP)

### ElevenLabs Streaming  
- Server-side API key protection (never expose to client)
- Stream audio chunks in real-time for low latency
- Handle voice switching between agents seamlessly
- Implement proper error handling for API limits

### Performance Considerations
- Audio latency < 1 second target
- Chunked transfer encoding for streaming
- Connection keep-alive for seamless audio
- Buffer management for network variations

   - Eliminated placeholder providers with simple IDs ("1", "2", "3")
   - Removed demo provider creation in voice agent page
   - System now relies entirely on real favorited providers

2. **Favorites Integration**
   - `handleProviderAction('voice-agent')` now saves to `FavoriteProvider`
   - Voice agent page loads from `getFavoriteProviders()`
   - ProviderSelector works with `FavoriteProvider` interface
   - Real MongoDB ObjectIds preserved throughout system

3. **Validation & Error Handling**
   - Added ObjectId format validation (24-character hex string)
   - Enhanced error logging with detailed provider ID information
   - Filtering of invalid providers in voice agent page
   - User-friendly messages for empty/invalid provider lists

4. **Data Flow Integrity**
   - Real provider `_id` from MongoDB → Favorites → Voice Agent
   - MCP server calls will receive valid ObjectIds
   - Featured services can be fetched using real provider IDs

### 🎯 User Workflow Now

1. **Search & Favorite**: User searches providers and favorites them (❤️ icon)
2. **Voice Agent Page**: User sees their favorited providers with real data
3. **Selection**: User selects favorited providers for AI calling
4. **API Calls**: System uses real MongoDB ObjectIds for MCP server integration
5. **Conversation**: AI agents get real provider context from database

**Status**: Ready for testing with real favorited providers and ElevenLabs API key.
