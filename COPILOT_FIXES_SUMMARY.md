# AI Copilot Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ "Low-cost" No Longer Triggers Free-Only Filter
- **Fixed in:** `/api/copilot/route.ts` line 214
- Changed from: `/(free|no\s*cost|low\s*-?cost|affordable)/.test(lc)`
- Changed to: `/(free|no\s*cost)/.test(lc)`
- Now "low-cost" and "affordable" won't filter out paid services

### 2. ✅ Stricter Dental Provider Matching
- **Fixed in:** `/api/copilot/search/route.ts`
- For dental queries, now requires services to actually contain dental terms
- Checks for: dent|teeth|tooth|oral|gum|cavity|filling|crown|cleaning
- Prevents non-dental providers with a single "Dental checkups" service from matching

### 3. ✅ Better Provider Selection
- **Fixed in:** `/api/copilot/route.ts`
- When LLM doesn't select providers, filters to only actual dental providers for dental queries
- Checks both category and service names for dental terms

### 4. ✅ Improved LLM Context & Output
- **Increased max_output_tokens:** From 850 to 1500 tokens
- **Better prompt instructions:**
  - Requires provider category in response
  - Demands SPECIFIC PRICES with dollar amounts
  - Instructs to only mention providers matching the service
  - For dental queries, only mention dental providers

### 5. ✅ Enhanced Fallback Response
- Shows actual prices for each provider
- Lists specific services with costs
- Focuses on matched services rather than generic text

## What the LLM Now Receives

### Better Instructions:
```
Write about the top 2-3 providers that BEST MATCH the query:
- Name each provider with their category (e.g., "Rinse Dental | Union St (Dentist)")
- Include SPECIFIC PRICES: "Dental cleaning: FREE", "Fillings: $23-64", etc.
- Note insurance acceptance: Medicaid/Medicare/Self-pay
- Focus on providers that actually match the service requested
- If looking for dental, ONLY mention dental providers
- Keep total response under 5 sentences
```

## Expected Behavior Now

For "Low-cost dental care near me":

1. **NO free-only filter** - Should search all providers
2. **Only dental providers** - Filters out diabetes centers, chiropractors, etc.
3. **Shows actual prices** - "Rinse Dental offers FREE cleanings, fillings from $23"
4. **Proper categories** - Shows "(Dentist)" after provider names
5. **Insurance info** - Notes which accept Medicaid/Medicare/Self-pay

## Debugging Added

Console logs now show:
- MongoDB query filters being applied
- Selected providers with their categories
- Whether providers have actual dental services
- Total providers found vs matched vs returned

## Testing

Try these queries to verify fixes:
1. "Low-cost dental care" → Should find dental providers with prices, not just free
2. "Free dental services" → Should only find free dental services
3. "Dentist" → Should only return actual dentists
4. "Dental cleaning under $50" → Should find affordable dental cleanings

The system should now:
- ✅ NOT filter for free-only on "low-cost" queries
- ✅ ONLY return actual dental providers for dental queries
- ✅ SHOW specific prices in the response
- ✅ MENTION provider categories
- ✅ FOCUS on relevant services
