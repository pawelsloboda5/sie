**Sample** **Clinic** **Phone** **Call** **Dialogues** **for**
**Appointment** **Scheduling**

Below are three **representative** **phone** **call** **transcripts**
between a patient and a clinic’s front-desk staff, covering common
scenarios: **(1)** scheduling a free breast cancer screening, **(2)**
scheduling a general check-up, and **(3)** scheduling a Medicaid-covered
diagnostic visit. These dialogues reflect realistic back-and-forth
interactions at community health centers or clinics that serve uninsured
and Medicaid patients. They include steps like confirming eligibility,
verifying insurance or uninsured status, finding appointment times, and
explaining clinic policies/documentation (e.g. bringing ID or insurance
cards)

Each of these dialogues illustrates how clinic staff guide patients
through scheduling while ensuring eligibility and logistics are
addressed. **Receptionists** **confirm** **insurance** **status** **or**
**program** **eligibility** (e.g. uninsured patients qualifying for free
services)
