AI Voice Agent Filter and Service Verification Implementation Document
This document outlines detailed instructions for implementing the conversational logic of the AI voice agent within our healthcare scheduling app. Specifically, the AI will explicitly verify certain user-selected filters and the featured service during the call with the healthcare provider.

✅ User-Selected Filters to Verify
Before the AI agent attempts to schedule an appointment, it must confirm the following user-selected filters clearly and explicitly with the provider:

Free services only

Accepts Medicaid

No SSN required

Additionally, confirm the featured service explicitly:

Free Breast Cancer Screening

📞 Conversational Logic and Structure
Below is the suggested conversational flow. This should be reflected clearly in your scripted dialogue generated via ElevenLabs:

Step-by-step Call Script Example:
[AI Voice Agent dials the Provider's number]

Receptionist answers: "Mercy Health Clinic, this is Sarah, how may I assist you?"

AI Voice Agent introduction:
"Hello, this is Alex from SIE Wellness calling on behalf of a client looking to schedule an appointment. I wanted to confirm some details before proceeding. Is now a good time?"

Receptionist: "Sure, go ahead."

✅ Verifying Filters:
1. Confirming Free Services Only
AI: "First, could you confirm that your clinic offers free healthcare services for eligible patients?"

Positive response example: "Yes, we provide several free healthcare services to eligible patients."

Negative response example: "No, we don't provide free services."

Negative handling: AI responds, "Thank you for clarifying. Unfortunately, we were looking specifically for free services. I appreciate your time." (End call and mark provider as not eligible)

2. Confirming Medicaid Acceptance
AI: "And do you accept Medicaid insurance at your clinic?"

Positive response example: "Yes, we accept Medicaid."

Negative response example: "No, we do not accept Medicaid."

Negative handling: AI responds, "Thank you for letting me know. Unfortunately, Medicaid acceptance is required for this patient. Thank you for your assistance." (End call)

3. Confirming No SSN Requirement
AI: "Lastly, is a social security number required to receive services at your clinic?"

Positive response (desired): "No, an SSN is not required."

Negative response (undesired): "Yes, we do require an SSN."

Negative handling: AI responds, "I see. We were specifically looking for clinics that do not require an SSN. Thank you for your assistance." (End call)

✅ Confirming Featured Service: Free Breast Cancer Screening
AI: "Could you also confirm if you offer free breast cancer screening services?"

Positive response: "Yes, we offer free breast cancer screening services."

Positive handling: Proceed to scheduling.

Negative response: "No, we don’t offer that service for free."

Negative handling: AI responds, "Thank you for clarifying. This specific service was a requirement, so I appreciate your time." (End call)

📅 Scheduling Appointment Based on User Availability
If all responses are positive:

AI: "Great! I’d like to schedule an appointment. The patient is available on Tuesday, August 5th at 10 AM, or Wednesday, August 6th at 2 PM. Do you have any availability during these times?"

Receptionist provides available slot matching user's availability: "Yes, Wednesday, August 6th at 2 PM works perfectly."

AI Confirmation: "Excellent. Please book that appointment. Could you confirm that the appointment for a free breast cancer screening is scheduled for Wednesday, August 6th at 2 PM?"

Receptionist: "Yes, that's confirmed."

AI Closing: "Thank you very much. Have a wonderful day!"

Appointment marked as scheduled successfully in UI.

Receptionist provides an alternative time not matching user's availability: "We only have Thursday at 4 PM available."

AI Negative handling: "Unfortunately, the patient is only available at the previously mentioned times. We’ll follow up later to see if something opens up. Thank you for your help." (Mark for follow-up in UI)

📌 UI Interaction Flow:
On the UI side, provide clear visual feedback of the agent's progress and state:

"Dialing..." → "Connected: Confirming details..." → "Filters Verified ✅" → "Scheduling Appointment..." → "Appointment Confirmed ✅" or "Unable to Schedule ❌"

The UI should dynamically reflect the conversation outcomes clearly and provide users with instant visual feedback.

🎙️ Integration with ElevenLabs:
Pre-record the conversation script (positive and negative responses) using ElevenLabs' text-to-speech.

Embed the resulting MP3 audio files within the UI to allow playback, demonstrating the natural and clear interaction.

✅ Example JSON Structure (Local Storage) for Persisting Provider Filters and Service Selection
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "savedProviders": [
    {
      "id": "68643b8c7d8ff5e76908a113",
      "name": "Mercy Health Clinic",
      "filters": {
        "free_services_only": true,
        "accepts_medicaid": true,
        "no_ssn_required": true
      },
      "featured_service": "Breast Cancer Screening",
      "appointment": {
        "scheduled": true,
        "time": "2025-08-06T14:00:00"
      }
    }
  ]
}
Ensure data persistence via local storage using methods such as:

js
Copy
Edit
// Saving to localStorage
localStorage.setItem('savedProviders', JSON.stringify(savedProviders));

// Retrieving from localStorage
const savedProviders = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('savedProviders'));
🎨 Modern UI/UX Recommendations:
Keep UI minimalistic, uncluttered, and intuitive.

Clearly label each filter verification step.

Use animations and smooth transitions between states.

Ensure easy accessibility for audio playback.

Provide clear, visually distinct states for success or failure of scheduling.

🧩 Placeholder/Stubs:
Use placeholders such as hardcoded positive responses for initial development:

js
Copy
Edit
const simulateAgentCall = () => ({
  free_services_verified: true,
  medicaid_accepted: true,
  no_ssn_required: true,
  featured_service_available: true,
  appointment_confirmed: true,
  confirmed_time: "2025-08-06T14:00:00"
});
Replace these placeholders gradually with real API or backend interactions in future iterations.
