# AI Copilot Service Variety Improvements

## Problem Statement
The AI copilot was showing mostly FREE consultation services and not enough variety in pricing, making it less useful for users who need to compare actual service costs.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Search Algorithm Enhancement (`/api/copilot/search`)

**Before:**
- Heavily prioritized free services first
- All free providers shown before any priced ones
- Limited variety in results

**After:**
- Balanced scoring system that values both free and reasonably-priced services
- Providers with BOTH free and priced services get bonus points
- Service variety (number of services) contributes to score
- Price ranges under $200 get priority
- Mix of free and paid services in top results

### 2. Provider Selection Logic (`/api/copilot/route.ts`)

**Before:**
- Simple slice of top providers
- No guarantee of variety

**After:**
- Ensures selection includes:
  - Up to 2 providers with free services
  - Up to 4 providers with priced services
  - Total of 3-6 providers for good variety
- Uses Set to avoid duplicates
- Guarantees mix of pricing options

### 3. Natural Language Generation

**Before:**
```
I found 3 providers for dental care:
• A Gentle Touch (FREE Free Consultations)
• Crown Dental Care (FREE Implant Consultation)
• Pearle Vision (FREE Free Adjustments and Cleaning)
Insurance: 3 accept self-pay
```

**After:**
```
I found some great options for dental care near you. A Gentle Touch 
offers FREE consultations and cleanings starting at just $75. Crown 
Dental Care provides comprehensive services, with basic fillings from 
$45-120 and x-rays at $30. For budget-conscious patients, Pearle Vision 
has free adjustments plus affordable treatments ranging from $50-200. 
Advanced Dental Solutions specializes in complex procedures with crowns 
at $450-800. Most accept self-pay patients and several offer payment plans.
```

### 4. LLM Prompt Engineering

**Improved Instructions:**
- Start with friendly, natural opener
- Mix FREE services with affordable paid options
- Use varied language ("starting at", "as low as", "offers free", "ranges from")
- Include specific price ranges for common services
- Write conversationally, not as bulleted lists
- End with helpful context about insurance/payment options

**Service Mix Requirements:**
- At least 4 providers should have actual prices (not just "FREE")
- Show variety: consultations, basic services, and premium options
- Include realistic price ranges based on actual data

### 5. Service Context Building

**Enhanced Context for LLM:**
- Filters services to show mix of free and priced (not just free first)
- Includes up to 1 free service and 3 priced services per provider
- Passes "affordable" services including those under $200 (not just under $100)
- Better variety in `notable_services` and `priced_services` arrays

## Testing

Run the improved test script:
```bash
